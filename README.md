Better-Fuel-Management


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.


* Fuel containers do not automatically vanish when they are empty.

* Fuel containers do not automatically appear when they are needed.

* If an action produces (e.g. cooking fish) or retrieves (e.g. harvesting a Kerosene Lamp) fuel and there is no appropriate container with sufficient capacity in the inventory, that fuel will be lost.<br />
You will need to manage your empty fuel containers!

* The fuel in the Storm Lantern can be drained again.
